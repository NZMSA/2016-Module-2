# 1. HTML, CSS and JS

## Introduction

HTML is a markup language for describing web documents **(web pages)**.

- HTML stands for <ul>Hyper Text Markup Language</ul>
- A markup language is a set of markup tags
- HTML documents are described by HTML tags
- Each HTML tag describes different document content

What is CSS?

- CSS stands for <ul>Cascading Style Sheets</ul>.
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

You will also learn JavaScript. It is
a programming language of the web that helps add interactivity to
your web pages.
It is useful since it is supported by all browsers and many web
development tools like Node.js and frameworks like AngularJS or ReactJS
utilise JavaScript.

# Part 1

## 1. HTML Structure.

First, let's create an empty HTML page. It will contain the head and the body.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

## 2. Setting the title of the page

Inside the head tags, we will type in the page title.

If you run index.html in a browser, you will see that it's title is now "Page Title".

```html
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
```

## 3. Adding a comment

Inside the body,we will type in a comment. This will not be displayed on the web page.

Comments may be useful for developers reading the code.

```html
<body>
  <!--This is a comment-->
</body>
```

## 4. Adding a Heading.

Below the comment, we will add the heading "My First Heading".

h1 is the most important heading. We can also use other headings like h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6, with h6 having the least importance.

```html
<!--This is a comment-->
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
```

## 5. Adding a surrounding div tag

Below the heading, write the following div:

```html
<div id="boxModel"></div>
```

We use this div to create the box model. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

## 6. Adding a Paragraph

Below the division, write the following paragraphs:

```html
<p class="firstParagraph">My first paragraph.</p>

<p>
  This is <br />
  a para<br />graph with line breaks
</p>
```

The first paragraph is displayed as one paragraph it also has a class name firstParagraph. The second paragraph contains line breaks because "br" tells the browser to start on a new line.

## 7. Whitespace is ignored.

Add the following below the paragraphs:

```html
This Is All Displayed On One Line
```

The text are all displayed on one line since HTML ignores whitespace.

## 8. Making a Hyperlink.

Add a link to microsoft.com below the set of text.

```html
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">This is a link to Microsoft</a>
```

The href attribute tells the browser where to go. In this instance, the link takes you to microsoft.com. The text in between the a tags are the displayed text in the browser.

## 9. Ordered lists

In order to use an ordered list, we need to type in the ol tags.

Inside those tags, we need to add a li for each element of that list.

The text inside the li tags is displayed as the text for each list element.

Since this is an ordered list, the list elements are automatically formatted with numbers.

Below the hyperlink add the following:

```html
<h2>Ordered List</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

## 10. Unordered Lists

Unordered lists are look like ordered lists and are coded like ordered lists as well.

The difference is that instead of formatting the list with numbers to show order, the list is formatted using bullet points by default.

In terms of coding, we use ul instead of ol. The rest of the code remains the same.

Below the ordered list, add the following:

```html
<h2>Unordered List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

## 11. Adding an image

Below the unordered list, add the following:

```
<img src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">
```

The src attribute tells the browser which image to use. The alt attribute tells the browser what text to display in case the image isn't found.

# Part 2

## 1. Create an external stylesheet

In the same folder as your index.html file, create a new file called "styles.css".

To do this, right click on an empty space, click New > Text Document. Then name it "styles.css".

## 2. Add an external stylesheet.

Inside the head tags of index.html, add the following line.

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the CSS page.
The href contains the location of the CSS file. In this case, it is stored locally, in the same folder as index.html, and is named "styles.css".

There will be no noticeable change seen in the HTML file, since we have not yet added any styles to "styles.css".

## 3. Add styles to the CSS file.

Open styles.css in your text editor. Then add the following line:

```css
h1 {
  color: yellow;
  font-size: 60px;
  background-color: #b0c4de;
}
```

Refresh your site. The h1 heading at the very top should now have a font color of yellow and a font size of 60px with a blue background colour represented by the hex value "#b0c4de".

## 4. Changing colour of text

Add this code below step 3 in styles.css

Changes the colour of the text in the first paragraph to red

```css
p.firstParagraph {
  color: Red;
}
```

## 5. Selectors

Add this code below step 4 in styles.css

Changes the colour of the link to hotpink when the cursor hovers over it

```css
a:hover {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

## 6. Box Model

Add this code below step 5 in styles.css

Demonstrates the use of the box model structure

```css
#boxModel {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 300px;
  border: 25px solid purple;
  padding: 25px;
  margin: 25px;
}
```

Explanation of the different parts:

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

## 7. Background

Add this code below step 6 in styles.css

Specifies an image to use as the background

```css
body {
  background-image: url("http://allpicts.in/download/1396/light_blue_wallpaper_pattern_for_background.jpg/");
}
```

# Part 3

### JavaScript Code

#### 1. Displaying output

Since we are using CodePen, we simply need to add the JavaScript
code inside the "JS" area. Type in the following JS code:

```js
document.write("Hello World");
```

This line of code will add the text "hello world" directly on the HTML page.
Since CodePen adds our JavaScript code at the bottom of the HTML page, we see
the text "hello world" at the bottom of the page.

#### Other Ways to Display Output:

There are many other ways to display output. Feel free to replace the above
code with the following code to see them in action.

- Alerts display a message box with a message of your choice. This output
  method may be obtrusive for the user so use alerts modestly.

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

In this case, the message was "Hello World".

- We can also select an element and change the contents between its tags.

```js
document.getElementById("boxModel").innerHTML = "Hello World";
```

In this case, we are getting the element with the Id of "boxModel".
Then we are changing the HTML code inside its tags, so it displays "Hello
World".

- We can also display output to the console

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

After typing this, click on the "console" button on the buttom-left part
of the screen to see the output.

You can also press F12 and click on the "Console" tab to open
the console.

#### 2. Creating Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

The syntax for a function in JavaScript is as follows:

```js
function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
        code to be executed
}
```

We call the function a certain name, and give it 2 inputs named parameter1
and parameter2. We can add more parameters if needed. And then, it
executes the code inside the curly braces. A value may be returned by
the function.

For our webpage, we will create a function that shows the date when
a button is clicked. Here is the code for the function:

```js
function show() {
  document.getElementById("demoButton").innerHTML = Date();
}
```

When the show function is called, it sets the content of the element
with the id of "demoButton", to the current date.

#### 3. Calling Functions

Once you are finished typing the show() function, you will notice that
nothing changes on your page. This is because you haven't called it.

We will call the show function when a button is clicked, so we need to
create this button. In the HTML area, type in the following code:

```js
<button id="demoButton" onclick="show()">
  Demo Button
</button>
```

Here, we created a button element. We typed in the show()
function as the value of the onclick attribute. This means that when the
onclick event is triggered, which means when the button is clicked, the
show() function is called.
